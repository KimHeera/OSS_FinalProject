## What does this project do?

This website is a site where **you can see the operating hours of facilities and stores in Handong University.**


## Why is this project useful?

Just because you stay at school 24 hours a day, you cannot memorize the operating hours of all the facilities in the school. In addition, in the case of facilities that are not frequently used, operating hours may be more confusing. The operating hours of all facilities and entry companies on Hisnet are posted on the notice, but there is an inconvenience of having to search and check the notice every time. So I made it into one website so that I could check all the information easily.
